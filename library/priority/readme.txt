USAGE:

1) Extract all files to your MATLAB path.
2) Try "priority" at the prompt. If it doesn't work out of the box, either compile for your platform (see below), or unzip one of the other binary packages, overwriting any files in the folder.
3) Type "priority" at the command prompt for usage information.



COMPILE:

1) Run "mex setup", if not already done.
2) Run "mex priority.cpp" from the installation folder.
3) A new binary will appear, if no errors, something like "priority.mexw32".
