% INPUT: starts at X0 and finds a minimum X to the function FUN, 
%           subject to the linear inequalities A*X <= B.
%           subject to the linear equalities Aeq*X = Beq as well as A*X <= B. 
%               (Set A = [] and B = [] if no inequalities exist.)
%           subject to a set of lower and upper bounds on the design variables, X, 
%               so that a solution is found in the range LB <= X <= UB. Use empty 
%               matrices for LB and UB if no bounds exist. Set LB(i) = -Inf if X(i) 
%               is unbounded below; set UB(i) = Inf if X(i) is unbounded above.
%           subjects the minimization to the constraints defined in NONLCON. The 
%               function NONLCON accepts X and returns the vectors C and Ceq, 
%               representing the nonlinear inequalities and equalities respectively. 
%               KTRLINK minimizes FUN such that C(X) <= 0 and Ceq(X) = 0. 
%               (Set LB = [] and/or UB = [] if no bounds exist.)
%           minimizes  with the default optimization parameters replaced by values 
%               in the structure OPTIONS, an argument created with the OPTIMSET 
%               function. See OPTIMSET for details. For a list of options accepted 
%               by FMINCON refer to the documentation. Use OPTIONS = [] as a  place 
%               holder if no options are set.
% OUTPUT:  FVAL returns the value of the objective function FUN at the solution X.
%          EXITFLAG that describes the exit condition of KTRLINK. For possible 
%               values of EXITFLAG and the corresponding exit conditions, refer to 
%               KNITRO (R) documentation.
%          OUPUT returns a structure OUTPUT with the number of iterations taken in 
%               OUTPUT.iterations, the number of function evaluations in 
%               OUTPUT.funcCount, the algorithm used in OUTPUT.algorithm, the 
%               first-order optimality in OUTPUT.firstorderopt, and the exit message 
%               in OUTPUT.message.
%          LAMBDA returns the Lagrange multipliers at the solution X: LAMBDA.lower 
%               for LB, LAMBDA.upper for UB, LAMBDA.ineqlin is for the linear 
%               inequalities, LAMBDA.eqlin is for the linear equalities, 
%               LAMBDA.ineqnonlin is for the nonlinear inequalities, and 
%               LAMBDA.eqnonlin is for the nonlinear equalities.
